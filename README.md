# BitBruteForce-Wallet (Only for Compressed Address!)
# Privtekey -> Compressed Pulickey -> Compressed Address
This is an effective script to Brute Force, the Private Key of any Bitcoin Public Address.

How does the script work? 
Very easy.

Every code IÂ´ve seen for the last year just generates randomly private and public addresses and checks the balance (very, very slow for the API Request).



This Script creates randomly private and public addresses without checking the balance, instead of making API Request, the created Public Address is compared with the list I own.

Long story short. 
Create Random Public Address (**RPA**) and check one by one with the Public Address (**PA**) at the list.

**if RPC == PA then
	YOU WINNED THE LOTTREY!
else
	KEEP SEARCHING MTF!**
